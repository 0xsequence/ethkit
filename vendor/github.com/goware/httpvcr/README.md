# HTTP VCR

For writing deterministic tests from external sources.

## Features

- Easy to use
- No flags (records when no cassete file is present, otherwise replays)
- Filter sensitive data (such as API keys)
- Modify requests before they are sent (e.g. to add row limits)
- Ignores request headers (so a timestamp or crypto signature does not break your cassette files)
- No dependencies
